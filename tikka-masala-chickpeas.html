        <p>Chicken tikka masala is without doubt one of the best meals ever concieved. For everyone ethically concious, this vegan version with chickpeas is even better. I recomend basmati rice as side-dish, which fits the tomato-ish sauce perfectly. Just like a goulash, leave whatever you don't gobble up immediately in the fridge overnight, and its spices make it mature to a food worthy of sacrifice for the Indian pantheon.</p>
